# Lab-II
Laborator de Informatica Industriala
(Console Apps, Windows Forms Apps, ASP.NET Web Apps)

Here I have solved all the exercises and problems from the .Net labs.

If you keep getting errors when running the code then simply close Visual Studio and open it again, this will fix it 90% of the time.

Also If you have any questions simply send me a message, and I will try to give you a response as soon as I can.
